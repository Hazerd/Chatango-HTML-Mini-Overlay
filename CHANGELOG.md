# Changelog #

### Sometime In The Future ###
- Make sure the A;S;L box and the content box are always the same width.
- Allow configuration of several features, colors, sizes, etc.

### v0.2 ###
- Added CHANGELOG.
- Updated README.
- Scripts are automatically deleted from the mini profile text before adding
it to the box, for security reasons.
- Changed the commas (`,`) in the ASL bar to semicolons (`;`), because it
looks confusing when the location is present as it includes another comma.
- Content box and ASL now auto-scale to the content, with a set minimum and
maximum width. If the maximum width is reached and the content is still too
large, then the content gets scaled to fit (as much as possible due to browser
limitations).
- Cleaned up the code a bit.

### v0.1 ###
- Initial Release
- Posted to GitHub and GreasyFork
